        <p style="color:#00ff00;">I used to have a Xanga account.</p>
        <p>Yup, I was one of those people who had music in the background, a scrolling marquee across the top, and a mouse trail of whatever I thought was cool at the time. That's when I started loving code. I drifted away from it in my college years, but now I'm back! I divide my time between working in Human Resources for a large corporation by day and surrounding myself with as much code as possible by night. I am always looking for ways to grow as a developer and I can't wait to see what I do next!</p>
